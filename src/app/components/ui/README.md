UI folder
=========

Insert here the smallest elements to create a bigger component.

See below:

_"Essentially in the `components/ui` folder, you will find all the components that comprise of the UI design of the application & are used repeatedly over the website. For example, button, link, grid, dropdown, input..._

_In the `components/common` folder though, you will find components that are also used repeatedly throughout the application, and are not single elements like the UI ones (button, link, input...). Instead, they are a combination of UI components with additional functionality, that are also meant to be used in various places through the code (e.g. avatar, footer...)"_
